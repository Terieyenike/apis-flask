# Flask APIs

Create an API in Flask which is a microframework for Python

This repo was presented in collaboration with WeareDevelopers and you can find the slides used for the presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_OmksJGoC-iQw3PS8P0yuKuBPmnj6xDYmEj-GWVFJBU/edit?usp=sharing).

Also this demo is based out of my talk on [Python Day](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/event/python-day-april-2023), WeareDevelopers titled, "**No more Node: Build APIs with Flask and test it with Postman**"
